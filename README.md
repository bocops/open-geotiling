# open-geotiling

A set of additional functions for Open Location Codes, based on the idea that any OLC identifies
a rectangular surface area. 

Using this wrapper class allows to
* determine whether two locations are in the same or adjacent "tiles"
* determine all neighboring tiles of a given one
* calculate a distance in tiles
* get an approximate direction from one tile to another
